    Email::StripMIME - Turn 'enhanced' emails back to plain text

DESCRIPTION
    Provides a sensible text representation of an email's content

SYNOPSIS
     use Email::StripMIME;

     my $email = join '', (<>);

     print Email::StripMIME::strip_mime( $email );

METHODS
  strip_mime ( $email_as_string )
    Returns the email you passed it, with all plain text attachments folded
    into the message body, and non-text attachments removed. Fiddles the

    If no plain text attachments were found, but there were HTML ones, it'll
    convert them to plain text and use those for the message body.
